# 🏠 Robber's Minimum Capability (Binary Search + Greedy)

## 🚀 Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money stashed in each house along a street. A robber wants to steal money but **cannot rob two adjacent houses**.

The **capability** of the robber is the **maximum amount** stolen from any single house during the heist.

You are also given an integer `k`, representing the **minimum number of houses** the robber must rob. It is always possible to rob at least `k` houses.

Return the **minimum capability** the robber needs out of all possible ways to rob at least `k` houses.

## 🔍 Example Walkthrough
### Example 1
**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
```
**Output:**
```cpp
5
```
**Explanation:** The three possible ways to rob 2 houses are:
- Rob houses at indices `[0,2]` → Capability = `max(2,5) = 5`
- Rob houses at indices `[0,3]` → Capability = `max(2,9) = 9`
- Rob houses at indices `[1,3]` → Capability = `max(3,9) = 9`

The **minimum capability** among these is **5**.

### Example 2
**Input:**
```cpp
nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2
```
**Output:**
```cpp
2
```
**Explanation:** The best choice is robbing houses `[0,4]`, leading to a capability of `max(2,1) = 2`.

## 📜 Short and Simple Algorithm (Pseudocode)
```
1. Set left = 1, right = max(nums)
2. While left < right:
   3. Set mid = (left + right) / 2
   4. Count how many houses can be robbed with max value ≤ mid:
      - Traverse nums
      - If nums[i] ≤ mid, rob it and skip next house
      - Else, move to next house
   5. If count < k, increase left (mid is too small)
   6. Else, decrease right (mid is a possible solution)
7. Return left
```

## 🛠️ Solution Approach
### 1️⃣ **Binary Search on Capability**
- The capability value lies between `1` and `max(nums)`.
- We perform **binary search** to minimize the capability.

### 2️⃣ **Greedy House Selection**
- Traverse `nums` greedily to check if we can rob **at least `k` houses** while skipping adjacent ones.

## 🏎️ Optimized Code (C++)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minCapability(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int left = 1, right = *max_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2, canRob = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.size() && canRob < k; ) {
                if (nums[i] <= mid) {
                    canRob++;
                    i += 2;  // Skip next house
                } else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
            
            if (canRob < k)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Binary Search:** `O(log M)` where `M = max(nums)`
- **Greedy Traversal:** `O(N)` where `N = nums.size()`
- **Total Complexity:** `O(N log M)`, efficient for large inputs.

## 📌 Walkthrough Table
### Example: `nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2`

| Iteration | `left` | `right` | `mid` | Houses Robbed (`canRob`) | Adjust `left` or `right` |
|-----------|--------|--------|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | 1 | 9 | 5 | Rob (2), Skip, Skip, Rob (3) → `canRob = 2` | `right = 5` |
| 2 | 1 | 5 | 3 | Rob (2), Skip, Skip, Rob (3) → `canRob = 2` | `right = 3` |
| 3 | 1 | 3 | 2 | Rob (2), Skip, Skip, Rob (1) → `canRob = 2` | `right = 2` |

### **Final Output**
```cpp
Output: 2
```
